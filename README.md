Here's a README.md document for the "Digit-Recognition" Kaggle notebook on GitHub, explaining the code with a focus on clarity and accessibility:

# Digit-Recognition: MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

#### Digit Recognizer without using Tensorflow, Keras or Pytorch and just Pure Numpy, to supplement my learning of Andrew Ng's Deep learning course, in order to understand the fundamentals of deep learning.
This project explores the MNIST dataset and builds a neural network to classify handwritten digits with high accuracy.

## Overview

The notebook encompasses the following key steps:

Data Loading and Preparation:

Import the MNIST dataset.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Preprocess the data (normalize pixel values).
Neural Network Architecture:

Define a simple two-layer neural network:
Input layer with 784 units (size of flattened images).
Hidden layer with 10 units and ReLU activation.
Output layer with 10 units and softmax activation.
Model Training:

Initialize weights and biases.
Implement forward propagation (calculate layer activations).
Implement backpropagation (calculate gradients).
Implement gradient descent to update weights and biases.
Evaluation:

Calculate accuracy on the testing set.
Visualize sample predictions.
## How to Use
